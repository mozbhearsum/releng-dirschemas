# Stuff that should exist in the root of any repository.
# Note that some things that seem like they should exist here (like HISTORY.rst or docker-compose.yml)
# don't, because monorepos like scriptworker-scripts have them in subdirectories.
# Other things, such as .pyup.yml, don't exist here because not all projects use Pyup
